if u dont want to f with installing libraries, then simply open installer.py

if u want to change keybinds, or reaction time or something then change variables in config.py

autoaccept propably works only with polish language, but u can give it try. if it doesnt work just do the accept button screenshot and name it akceptuj.png

and ofc the main file is named main.py
