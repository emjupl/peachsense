A shitty CS:GO trainer written in python. (spaghetti with no comments)
Project was written for fun, wasn't made for being fastest, just for educational purposes.

Key features:
- Color Triggerbot
- Bunnyhop
- Autoaccept

If u dont want to mess with installing libraries, then simply open installer.py
if u want to change keybinds, or reaction time or something then change variables in config.py
Autoaccept probably works only with polish language, but u can give it try. if it doesnt work just do the accept button screenshot and name it akceptuj.png

(it will get no more updates, probably will work forever so u can download and use it)
